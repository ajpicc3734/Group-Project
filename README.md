# "Trending Music"

## Description

The Trending Music application is designed to provide the user with a "one-stop shop" for obtaining new music videos and song lyrics. The application uses the YouTube API to pull data from a new music playlist. The playlist provides the user with the title of the video, the video thumbnail, a link to watch the video, and a description of the video. Due to Google security measures when the "Press First & Close Pop-up" button is pressed, an error message is displayed. Once this new Google generated window is closed, press the "Display New Music" button. Now your new music video playlist will be applied to the page.

This application also uses the OVH lyrics API to return song lyrics through a search function. The user can enter any artist and corresponding song title to receive the lyrics for the searched song!

The responsive design was developed using Materialize and has been optimized for mobile devices (removing the "description info" for easier navigation). 

The video playlist will be updated weekly - helping you to stay on trend with the latest music!
